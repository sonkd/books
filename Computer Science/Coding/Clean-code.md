## You have been impeded by bad code. So, why did you write it?

- Were your trying to go fast? Were you in a rush? Maybe you didn't have time to do good job.
Then, We've all said we'd go back and clean up later. But, Later equals never - LeBlanc's rule
- In a project, maybe have new staff. And they don't know how to change to matches the design intent or thwarts.

## The total cost of a mess code


## Code sense
- Progammer with `code-sense` will look at a messy module and see options and variations.
- Clean code does one thing well.
- Clean code is focused.
- Clean code is simple and direct - Bad code tries to do too much.
- Clean code has unit and acceptance code; code without tests, it not clean.
- If you want to your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.

## Meaningful Names

- Use Pronounceable Names: variable name can be pronounceable.
- Use Searchable Names: other dev can search
- Names: `Say what you mean. Mean what you say.`

## Functions

- The first rule is small, the second rule is the function smaller than and do one thing.

## Comment
